# First Bounty: Transaction History Report Generator

Being able to view an overview of transactions is essential for tax purposes, record keeping and other purposes.

Our first bounty is a Transaction History Report Generator, which will generate a complete transaction history report that the entire DFK community can utilize.

## Project Requirements

* Generate a complete transaction history report for any wallet over any customized time frame
* Account for every smart contract transaction in the game with a clear line item that is tagged with transaction type and whether this was awarded via a quest, payment, sell of hero, and the price change when sold relative to when received
* Quantify all gains and losses for the wallet address entered
    - kingdom.watch personal/Personal.vue has `loadPrices()`
* Have a mechanism for easily adding all new DFK smart contracts as they are released
* Be able to track transactions across multiple EVM based blockchains
* Bonus points for accommodating other currencies than USD

## Reward

A sizable bounty of 5000 JEWEL tokens will be rewarded to the individual or group that creates the best final product that is fully functional.

The top four runner up individuals or teams will also be rewarded 500â€“1000 JEWEL tokens, based on the outcome of their product. All participants who submit a product by the deadline will receive a special in-game reward!

Winners will be determined by a DeFi Kingdoms community vote.

## Timeline

The deadline for products to be presented is January 3, 2022. Winners will be announced once the DFK community has voted.
